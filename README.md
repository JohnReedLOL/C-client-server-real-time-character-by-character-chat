# C-client-server-real-time-character-by-character-chat
This terminal chat app differs from the usual chat apps in that it allows the other person to see what you are typing as you type it, in real time, rather than after you hit **enter**. It has a customization that makes it play a bell noise in the terminal when you hit the "@" character. They are supposed to type when they hear the bell. Also, if you hit "#" it makes a newline on their end for new paragraphs. The code is written in 2017 compliant C and is based off https://www.binarytides.com/programming-udp-sockets-c-linux/ . I compile the code with the gcc compiler.
